Now that Flash is dead, you can find (and play) this project in two places:

1. Included in BlueMaxima's Flashpoint archive project, found here: https://bluemaxima.org/flashpoint/
2. Through Newgrounds' downloadable player, found here: https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/692720

You can also download the SWF from my website, https://nemesis-game.com/

Thanks for loving and caring about this game,
Joeshua
