Hi, if you're here actually looking at this code, it means you probably know some things about programming.

This was my first big project ever; I thought I knew how to code when we started, but I had no idea.

This is, honestly, spaghetti-code. In the worst possible form. I somehow carried this ship to the finish at the time we were making it, but I am not particularly proud of the form or function of this game.

This game was incredibly important to me to learn *why* not to code games like this. I learned so many lessons and had so many frustrating experiences, it flipped my entire world upside-down... multiple times, throughout the course of this game.

If you're here evaluating me as a candidate for a job, know that I'm not embarassed about this code. We all have written projects that look like this; that we weren't ready for, and scrambled through, trying to make it work. This game was a very important step for me in getting better. I'm happy for you to look at it, and compare it to my newer work. Hopefully you'll agree with me that getting good at programming takes a certain amount of fumbling in the dark.

If you're here out of curiousity, know that everyone starts at a point like this. You can make a good game without good code. And completing that first game is worth way, way more than re-starting it over and over. See it through to the end. There's a lot of lessons you can only learn if you do that.
